Since december 2019, I am Head of Research at [CleverlyAI](https://cleverly.ai/) in Lisbon, Portugal, driving NLP (Natural Language Processing) and ML (Machine Learning) methods to help customer support teams to become more efficient.

Before that I researched for 6 years in the industry: 4 years at [Priberam Labs](http://labs.priberam.com/) where I developed ML methods to solve NLP problems and 2 years at [Feedzai](https://feedzai.com/) where I worked on ML apporaches for preventing fraud.

Until 2013 I mostly worked on image processing in academia. I was a Postdoc fellow at [IT](https://www.it.pt/) of Lisbon, working on image reconstruction under the supervision of [Mário A. T. Figueiredo](http://www.lx.it.pt/~mtf/). And my PhD was in the field of blind image separation and blind deconvolution, under the supervision of [Luís B. Almeida](http://www.lx.it.pt/~lbalmeida/)
