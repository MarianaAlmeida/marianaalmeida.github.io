# Mariana SC Almeida


Since December 2019 I am Head of Research at Cleverly, in Lisbon, Portugal, where I work on NLP (Natural Language Processing) and ML (Machine Learning).

Before that I worked for 6 years in research groups on industry: 4 years at [Priberam Labs](http://labs.priberam.com/) where I research ML methods applied to NLP and 2 years on [Feedzai](https://feedzai.com/) where I worked on ML methods for preventing fraud detection.

Until 2013 I mostly worked on image processing. I was a Postdoc fellow at [IT](https://www.it.pt/) of Lisbon, working on image reconstruction under the supervision of [Mário A. T. Figueiredo](http://www.lx.it.pt/~mtf/). And my PhD was in the field of blind image separation and blind deconvolution, under the supervision of [Luís B. Almeida](http://www.lx.it.pt/~lbalmeida/), at [IT](https://www.it.pt/) of Lisbon, Portugal.
